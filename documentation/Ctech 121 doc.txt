I had most of this in a table like in the example on the canvas page. 
It did not translate well when saved as  a .txt 
I also had a model of a graphics window that I was thinking of using in here but that did not sow up in the .txt



	Start program
		Empty grid 
		Tell player 1 to make the first move


P1 clicks on square on grid
		Draw X
	Test to see if square is full
	Test to see if game is won
	Test to see if game board is full
	Switch players


P2 clicks on square
	draw O
	Test to see if square is full
	Test to see if game is won
	Test to see if game board is full
	Switch players


	Repeat process until draw or winner is selected
	Perform tests and switch players if pass all tests
	Player picks full square
	If square is full tell player to pick again




	Player gets 3 in a row
	If game is won tell player the winner  and close program




	Player picks last open spot
	If board is full w/ no winner, tell players it's a draw and close program
